## Writing Style and Philosophy

### Business-Focused Scenarios
All scenarios are written from the perspective of business users (project managers, estimators, administrators) rather than technical implementation details. The scenarios focus on **WHAT** the system should do, not **HOW** it does it.

### Current Behavior Documentation
**IMPORTANT**: These scenarios document the current behavior of the system as it exists today, including:
- ‚úÖ Intended functionality and business logic
- ‚úÖ Current calculations and validation rules  
- ‚úÖ Existing UI workflows and interactions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Known bugs and behavioral quirks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Performance issues and edge cases

### Gherkin Format Standards

#### Scenario Structure
```gherkin
Scenario: Business-focused scenario title
  Given [initial context/preconditions] 
  When [specific user action or event]
  Then [expected outcome or system response]
  And [additional expected outcomes]
```

#### Background Usage
Each feature file includes a `Background` section establishing common preconditions for all scenarios in that feature.

#### Data Tables and Examples
Complex data is represented using Gherkin data tables:
```gherkin
Given I have a feature with the following details:
  | Property    | Value        |
  | id          | F1           |
  | description | Test Feature |
  | manDays     | 10           |
```

#### Bug Documentation Format
Known issues are clearly marked and explained:
```gherkin
Scenario: Description validation discrepancy between check and error message
  Given I am creating a new feature
  When I enter a description with exactly 4 characters
  Then the validation check should pass (actual requirement is 3+ characters)
  But the error message incorrectly states "10 characters minimum"
  # BUG: Error message claims 10 character minimum but code validates 3+ characters
```

## Key Business Rules Documented

### Calculation Formulas
- **Feature Man Days**: `realManDays * (100 + riskMargin) / expertiseLevel`
- **Auto Coverage**: `totalFeatureManDays * 0.3` (30% of features)
- **Development Phase**: `sum(featureManDays) + coverage`

### Validation Rules
- Feature ID: Must follow BR-### pattern with auto-increment
- Feature Description: 3+ characters (despite error message claiming 10+)
- Man Days: Must be positive numbers
- Project Structure: Must have project, features, phases, config properties

### Configuration Hierarchy
1. **Global Defaults** ‚Üí Base configuration for all projects
2. **Project Config** ‚Üí Inherits global, can be customized
3. **Project Overrides** ‚Üí Project-specific additions stored separately

### Phase Structure
8 standard phases with specific roles and effort distributions:
- **Pre-development**: functionalSpec, techSpec
- **Development**: development (auto-calculated)  
- **Testing**: sit, uat, vapt
- **Deployment**: consolidation, postGoLive

## Test Automation Integration

These Gherkin scenarios can be integrated with test automation frameworks:

### JavaScript/Node.js
- **Cucumber.js**: Direct Gherkin execution
- **Jest + Cucumber**: Combine with existing Jest test suite
- **Playwright + Cucumber**: End-to-end testing with Gherkin scenarios

### Setup Example
```javascript
// cucumber.js configuration
module.exports = {
  default: {
    require: ['features/step-definitions/**/*.js'],
    format: ['progress', 'html:reports/cucumber.html'],
    paths: ['features/**/*.feature']
  }
};
```

### Step Definitions Structure
```javascript
Given('the Software Estimation Manager application is running', function() {
  // Setup application state
});

When('I create a new project', function() {
  // Perform user action
});

Then('a new project should be created with name {string}', function(name) {
  // Verify expected outcome
});
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Bug Fixes**: Update bug documentation when issues are resolved
- ‚úÖ **Feature Changes**: Modify scenarios when functionality changes
- ‚úÖ **New Discoveries**: Add scenarios for newly discovered behaviors
- ‚ùå **Don't**: Change scenarios to match desired behavior instead of actual behavior

### Scenario Naming Conventions
- Use business-focused titles describing user goals
- Start with action verbs (Create, Validate, Calculate, Export, etc.)
- Include relevant business context and outcomes
- Avoid technical implementation details

### Error Scenario Guidelines
- Clearly mark with "# BUG:" comments
- Explain the nature of the issue
- Document workarounds if available
- Include expected vs. actual behavior

## Contributing

When adding new scenarios or modifying existing ones:

1. **Focus on Business Value**: Write scenarios that deliver business value
2. **Document Reality**: Capture actual system behavior, not ideals
3. **Use Clear Language**: Write for business stakeholders, not just developers
4. **Include Edge Cases**: Cover error conditions and boundary cases
5. **Maintain Structure**: Follow existing format and organization patterns
