Feature: Feature Management
  As a project estimator
  I want to manage project features with details, calculations, and validations
  So that I can accurately estimate project effort and costs

  Background:
    Given the Software Estimation Manager application is running
    And the VSCode-style sidebar navigation is functional
    And I have a project loaded with configuration data
    And the feature management system is initialized
    And modal management system prevents conflicts between different modal types

  Scenario: Add new feature with automatic ID generation
    Given I have existing features with IDs "BR-001" and "BR-003"
    When I open the add feature modal
    Then the feature ID field should be automatically populated with "BR-004"
    And the modal title should indicate "Add New Feature"
    And all form fields should be empty except the generated ID

  Scenario: Calculate man days using specific formula
    Given I am creating a feature
    And I enter 10 real man days
    And I set expertise level to 80
    And I set risk margin to 20
    When the calculation is triggered
    Then the calculated man days should be 15.00
    And the formula used should be: real man days * (100 + risk margin) / expertise level

  Scenario: Handle zero expertise to prevent division by zero
    Given I am creating a feature
    And I enter 10 real man days  
    And I set expertise level to 0
    And I set risk margin to 10
    When the calculation is triggered
    Then the calculated man days should be 0.00
    And no division by zero error should occur

  Scenario: Real-time calculation updates as inputs change
    Given I have the feature form open
    When I modify the real man days field
    Then the calculated man days should update immediately
    When I modify the expertise level field
    Then the calculated man days should update immediately
    When I modify the risk margin field
    Then the calculated man days should update immediately

  Scenario: Populate feature form for editing existing feature
    Given I have a feature with the following details:
      | Property     | Value              |
      | id           | F1                 |
      | description  | Test Feature       |
      | category     | cat1               |
      | featureType  | ft1                |
      | supplier     | sup1               |
      | realManDays  | 10                 |
      | expertise    | 90                 |
      | riskMargin   | 15                 |
      | manDays      | 12.5               |
      | notes        | Test notes         |
    When I open the edit feature modal for this feature
    Then all form fields should be populated with the correct values
    And the modal title should indicate "Edit Feature"

  Scenario: Validate feature data before saving
    Given I am creating a new feature
    When I enter a description with less than 3 characters
    Then the validation should fail
    And an error message should indicate minimum description requirements
    When I enter valid data for all required fields
    Then the validation should pass
    And the feature should be ready for saving

  Scenario: Close feature modal using multiple methods with modal isolation
    Given the feature modal is open
    When I click the close button (Ã—) in the modal header
    Then the modal should close properly using modal management system
    And event listeners should be cleaned up appropriately
    When I open the modal again and click outside the modal content area
    Then the modal should close due to backdrop click handling
    When I open the modal again and press the Escape key
    Then the modal should close via keyboard event handling
    When I open the modal again and click the Cancel button with VSCode styling
    Then the modal should close and discard changes
    And the form should be reset to prevent data contamination

  Scenario: Filter features by category, supplier, and type
    Given I have features with different categories, suppliers, and types
    When I select "Category A" from the category filter
    Then only features with "Category A" should be visible
    When I also select "Supplier X" from the supplier filter
    Then only features with both "Category A" and "Supplier X" should be visible
    And the filtering should use AND logic between criteria

  Scenario: Search features by text content
    Given I have features with various descriptions
    When I enter "authentication" in the search field
    Then only features containing "authentication" in their description should be visible
    And the search should be case-insensitive
    When I clear the search field
    Then all features should become visible again

  Scenario: Populate dropdown options from configuration
    Given the configuration contains suppliers, categories, and feature types
    When the feature form is displayed
    Then the supplier dropdown should contain all configured suppliers
    And the category dropdown should contain all configured categories
    And project-specific items should have visual indicators
    And global items should be displayed without special indicators

  Scenario: Render feature table with improved scrollable structure
    Given I have features in the project
    When the features table is rendered within the VSCode layout
    Then the table should be contained within a table-container with proper scrolling
    And the table should have expandable-table CSS class for row expansion functionality
    And each feature should have proper expand/collapse controls
    And the table should integrate well with the VSCode dark theme
    And scrolling should work smoothly within the available space

  Scenario: Save new feature to project
    Given I have filled out a valid feature form
    When I click the Save Feature button
    Then the feature should be added to the project features list
    And the project should be marked as dirty
    And the feature modal should close
    And the features table should refresh to show the new feature
    And the project summary should be updated

  Scenario: Update existing feature
    Given I am editing an existing feature
    And I modify the feature details
    When I save the changes
    Then the feature should be updated in the project features list
    And the project should be marked as dirty
    And the changes should be reflected in the features table

  Scenario: Delete feature from project
    Given I have a feature in the project
    When I request to delete the feature
    Then the feature should be removed from the project features list
    And the project should be marked as dirty
    And the features table should refresh without the deleted feature
    And the project summary should be updated

  # Modal Integration and Isolation

  Scenario: Feature modal isolation from other system modals
    Given I have a feature modal open
    When other system components attempt to open modals (configuration, capacity, etc.)
    Then the feature modal should remain functional and isolated
    And modal management should prevent conflicts between different modal types
    And event listeners should be properly scoped to each modal
    And modal z-index and overlay management should work correctly

  Scenario: Feature modal styling consistency with VSCode theme
    Given I open the feature modal
    When I examine the modal appearance
    Then the modal should use VSCode dark theme styling
    And buttons should have consistent btn-primary and btn-secondary styling
    And form inputs should integrate with the VSCode color scheme
    And modal header, body, and footer should follow VSCode layout patterns

  Scenario: Feature form integration with improved table
    Given I save a new feature through the modal
    When the feature is added to the project
    Then the improved table structure should be updated
    And the table scrolling behavior should remain smooth
    And expandable rows should function properly with new data
    And table sorting and filtering should work with the added feature

  # Error Scenarios - Documenting Known Bugs and Quirks

  Scenario: Element waiting logic logs warnings instead of errors
    Given the system is waiting for DOM elements to become available
    When an expected element is not found within the timeout period
    Then a warning should be logged to the console
    But no error should be thrown
    And the system should continue processing
    And this represents graceful degradation rather than hard failures

  Scenario: Description validation inconsistency between check and error message
    Given I am creating a feature
    When I enter a description with exactly 4 characters
    Then the validation check should pass (requires 3+ characters)
    But if validation fails, the error message should incorrectly state "10+ characters required"
    And this represents a discrepancy between validation logic and error messaging
    And users receive conflicting information about requirements

  Scenario: Modal event listener management issues
    Given feature modals are opened and closed repeatedly
    When event listeners are attached and detached
    Then some listeners may not be properly cleaned up
    And this could lead to memory leaks over time
    And modal interactions might become unreliable
    And the system should implement better listener lifecycle management

  Scenario: Feature form DOM manipulation inefficiencies
    Given the feature form is displayed and interacted with
    When DOM updates and calculations occur
    Then redundant DOM queries may be executed
    And element cloning may be used unnecessarily for listener management
    And this represents inefficient DOM access patterns
    And performance could be improved with better DOM caching strategies

  Scenario: Feature form validation allows shorter descriptions than error message indicates
    Given I am validating feature data
    When I enter a description with 4 characters
    Then the feature should pass validation
    But the error message for short descriptions should claim "10 characters minimum"
    And this creates confusion between actual validation rules and user messaging
    And validation messages should be aligned with actual validation logic
